# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** Casa Barcelo Rooftop Hostel
**Type:** Party Hostel / Boutique Hybrid
**Star Rating:** 3.5

### History
Built in 1890 as a textile merchant's residence. Converted to apartments in the 1960s, fell into disrepair by the 1990s. Bought and renovated in 2015 by a Dutch entrepreneur who saw potential in the rooftop terrace. The building retains original Catalan modernist features - decorative ironwork, tile floors, ornate balconies - but the rooftop is all modern bar and lounge.

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
The corner balcony on the rooftop level. It's a small extension of the terrace that juts out over Carrer dels Comtes, a narrow lane four stories below. The railing is original wrought iron from 1890 - beautiful, decorative, but only 90cm high (modern code requires 110cm). The balcony is popular for smoking and intimate conversations away from the main party. At night, it's poorly lit, adding to the danger.

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Jordi Mas
**Description:** Early 30s, former party kid who now runs the front desk. Knows everyone's business, has seen everything, generally looks the other way.
**Role in death:** Oblivious to the specific danger but will later testify about Tyler's behavior over the previous days.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Maria | Older local woman, warns young women about the balconies |
| Security | None official | Jordi handles incidents |
| Bar/Kitchen | Pau | DJ and bartender, keeps the party going, served Tyler his last drinks |
| Manager | Eva (Dutch) | Owns the place, rarely on-site, will face liability questions |

### Staff Knowledge
They know the balcony railings are technically below code but have never had an incident. Jordi has broken up fights before but always inside. The rooftop is supposed to close at 2am but during La Merce, everything runs late.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Recovery mode - guests sleeping until noon, nursing hangovers in the courtyard. A few cultural tourists head out to see Gaudi. The rooftop is closed for cleaning and prep.

### Night Vibe
Transforms completely. Pre-drinks start at 8pm, rooftop bar opens at 9pm, peak party at midnight. During La Merce, the energy is electric - everyone is there for the same reason: to celebrate until sunrise.

### Guest Demographics
Mostly 20-30 year olds, heavy on Americans, Brits, and Australians. Gap year students, recent graduates, young professionals on holiday. A few older travelers who picked the wrong week for a quiet trip.

### Reputation
"Best rooftop bar in the Gothic Quarter." "Great for meeting people." "Staff is super chill." "Watch your stuff though." "Wild during La Merce - amazing."

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Walk from Las Ramblas (5 min), metro to Jaume I (3 min walk), tricky to find down narrow streets

### Check-in Process
Casual - passport photocopy, quick orientation, key card for dorm, warning to keep valuables locked up, invitation to the rooftop bar that night.

### Rules
- Quiet hours 11pm-8am (largely ignored during festival)
- No outside alcohol on rooftop (not enforced)
- Maximum capacity on rooftop (never enforced)
- "Be respectful" (whatever that means)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: good)

- [x] Laundry (one machine)
- [ ] Pool
- [x] Bar (rooftop)
- [x] Rooftop

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Barcelona's Gothic Quarter layout and atmosphere should be accurate. La Merce festival details (dates, activities, atmosphere) should be correct. Balcony fall incidents are unfortunately common in Barcelona during tourist season - usually accidental, occasionally involving confrontations.

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Catalan vs. Spanish identity is significant - characters should acknowledge this
- Barcelona residents have complicated feelings about mass tourism
- Police are Mossos d'Esquadra (Catalan), not Policia Nacional
