## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Pride

**How it manifests:**
- Cannot let any perceived slight go unanswered
- Turns every interaction into a competition
- Would rather die than back down in front of witnesses
- Treats women as conquests to be won

**How it kills them:**
His refusal to walk away from a confrontation with Marcus - especially over a woman - means he stays on that balcony until the fatal push.

- **Distinguishing features:** Square jaw, confident smile, Patagonia tan lines, a small scar on his eyebrow from a "legendary" frat fight

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Confident - becomes aggressive refusal to yield
2. Social - becomes need to dominate every group dynamic

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Territorial - sees Marcus talking to Sofia and can't let it stand
2. Impulsive - responds to provocation without thinking through consequences

### Pet Peeves
- Men who are "soft" or "beta"
- Europeans who act superior about American culture
- Being told what to do by anyone

### Fears
- Surface fear: Looking weak in front of others
- Deeper fear: That he's not actually special, just privileged

## Background

### Origin Story
Third-generation oil money from Houston. Everything handed to him - the prep school, the lacrosse scholarship, the finance job waiting at daddy's friend's firm. Never faced real consequences for anything. Every mistake was cleaned up by family lawyers or donations.

### Why They Travel
A "victory lap" before entering the real world. Also, a girl he was seeing suggested he needed to "grow up," so he's proving he can be worldly while actually just getting drunk in different countries.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Following the Mediterranean party circuit. Barcelona for La Merce festival. This hostel has a rooftop bar with views of the city - perfect for Instagram.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "Bro," "Sick," "Legendary," "Crushed it," "Low-key"
- Avoids words like: "Sorry," "You're right," "I was wrong"
- Catchphrases: "You know who my dad is?" / "Back at Texas..."

### Speech Pattern
- Loud, takes up sonic space
- Interrupts frequently
- Everything is either "amazing" or "trash"
- Heavy on sports metaphors

### Internal Monologue Style
Defensive, constantly rating himself against other men. Reads like a scoreboard - who's winning, who's losing, where does he rank?

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram
- **Follower count:** 3,200 (mostly from Greek life connections)
- **Posting style:** Party shots, scenic backdrops, flexing disguised as candid
- **Last post before death:** Video of rooftop bar with caption "Barcelona knows how to party"

### Online vs Reality
Projects effortless success; privately anxious about living up to family expectations and whether the Goldman offer was actually merit-based.

## Relationships

### Family
- Father (William): Successful oil executive who's never said he's proud
- Mother (Caroline): Social climber who measures success in status
- Brother (Blake): The successful one, already a VP somewhere

### Friends
- Frat brothers back home who worship him
- No real friends on the road - just drinking buddies

### Romantic
- Just ended things with Sofia, a Spanish girl he'd been traveling with for three days. She got tired of him.

### At the Hostel
- Immediate rivalry with Marcus, a British guy who's everything Tyler pretends to be (genuinely confident, genuinely traveled)
- Sees Sofia talking to Marcus and decides she's "his" to reclaim

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes up hungover at noon, does fifty push-ups to prove he's fine, immediately starts drinking again with the La Merce festival as excuse.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Laughing with other Americans at the hostel bar, feeling like the alpha of the group. Then he sees Sofia with Marcus on the rooftop and everything changes.

### Final Thoughts
A flash of disbelief - this isn't how it's supposed to go. He always wins. The ground rushing up. His father's disappointed face.

### Last Words
"Don't you fucking touch m-"

## Writing This Character

### POV Notes
When in this character's head:
- They notice: Power dynamics, who's looking at him, threats to his status
- They ignore: His own drunkenness, warning signs that Marcus is dangerous, opportunities to de-escalate
- They judge: Every man by whether they're competition, every woman by whether they're available

### Key Scenes Checklist
- [x] Introduction scene establishing archetype - loud entrance to rooftop bar, buying shots for everyone, being "that guy"
- [x] Fatal flaw demonstration (early) - tells story of fighting a bouncer, clearly embellished
- [x] Sympathetic moment (make reader care) - phone call with dad where he tries and fails to earn approval
- [x] Warning ignored scene - friend suggests maybe let the Sofia thing go
- [x] Point of no return - follows Marcus and Sofia to the balcony, starts shoving
- [x] The death
